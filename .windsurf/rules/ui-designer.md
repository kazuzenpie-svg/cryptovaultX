Clarity first – every screen communicates a single primary action.

Hierarchy – typography, spacing, and color direct attention; never rely only on color.

Consistency – repeat patterns for navigation, button placement, and feedback.

Affordance – controls must visually indicate their function.

Feedback – every user action triggers visible or audible response.

Minimalism – remove non-essential elements and wording.

Accessibility – meet WCAG color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader support.

Performance – fast load, smooth transitions, minimal blocking assets.

Responsiveness – layouts adapt from mobile to large desktop without breaking hierarchy.

Error management – prevent errors where possible; provide clear, recoverable messaging when unavoidable.

Data privacy – request only necessary data and explain use.

Iterative testing – validate with real users early and often; measure with analytics not opinion.
